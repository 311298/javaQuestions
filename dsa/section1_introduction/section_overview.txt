Well don't nay code in section few points, after watching the whole section:

1. 2 types of ds -> primitive and non-primitive
2. primitive -> int,float, char, boolean 
3. non-primitive -> linear and non-linear
4. linear -> static and dynamic
5. static -> array (fixed memory)
6. non-static -> linked list, stack , queue (dynamic memory)
7. Types of algo -> simple recursion, divide and conqueror, dynamic programming, greedy, brute force, randomized.

    PUSH YOURSELF, NO ONE ELSE GONNA DO IT FOR YOU.
